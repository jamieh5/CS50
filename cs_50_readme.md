# 🎓 CS50 — My Harvard CS50x Progress & Projects

Welcome to my **CS50 repository**! This space organizes all my completed assignments, problem sets, and projects from **Harvard’s CS50** program.

---

## 🧑‍💻 What is CS50?
CS50 is Harvard’s introduction to computer science — a beginner‑friendly yet rigorous course covering:

- ⚙️ **C Programming**
- 🧠 **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- 💾 **Memory Management**
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🗂️ **SQL & Databases**
- 🌐 **Web Programming (HTML/CSS/JS/Flask)**

This repository reflects my journey from foundational programming concepts to more advanced topics and full projects.

## 📂 What’s Inside Each Folder?
### **CS50x/**
Contains solutions to all problem sets and assignments from the main CS50 curriculum:
- C programming
- Arrays & strings
- Algorithms
- Data structures
- Memory (heap, stack, pointers)

### **CS50P/** *(if present)*
Holds Python assignments and projects from the CS50P track.

### **Future Additions**
You may later find folders for:
- 🌐 Web projects (HTML/CSS/JS/Flask)
- 🗄️ SQL/database assignments
- 🚀 Final project

---

## 📈 My Progress
- ✔️ Completed core weeks: C fundamentals, arrays, strings, memory, algorithms
- ✔️ Solutions stored + versioned in repo
- ✔️ Started Python track (see **CS50P/**)
- 🔧 Organized repo for long‑term maintainability

---

## 🎯 Goals & Next Steps
- Continue completing remaining CS50 weeks
- Build and document a **final project** (in its own `project/` folder)
- Add `DESIGN.md` for larger projects to explain architecture & decisions
- Keep code clean, commented, and include any required `requirements.txt`

---

## 💡 Why This Repository Exists
This repo serves as:
- 🗂️ **A self‑tracking tool** for my assignments
- 🧭 **A learning log** to see how far I’ve come
- 💼 **A portfolio showcase** for future opportunities
- 📚 **A reference** for myself or others studying CS50
