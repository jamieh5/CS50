CS50 — My Harvard CS50x Progress / Projects

Welcome to my CS50 repository. Here I collect and organize my completed assignments, problem sets, and projects from Harvard’s CS50 course.

🧑‍💻 What is CS50

CS50 is Harvard’s introduction to computer science and programming for beginners and non-specialists, covering foundational topics such as C, Python, data structures, memory management, algorithms, SQL, web development, and more.

This repo reflects my journey through the course — from early weeks learning the basics to more complex problems and (eventually) project work.

Current Structure of the Repository

CS50/
├── CS50x/           ← Assignments & exercises for CS50x (C, algorithms, etc.)
├── CS50P/           ← (if applicable) Python/CS50P assignments & projects  
└── README.md        ← This file  

What’s in Each Folder

CS50x/ — contains solutions for problem sets and assignments from the core CS50 curriculum (C, arrays, algorithms, data structures, memory, etc.).

CS50P/ — if present, this folder holds projects and code written in Python as part of the “CS50P / Python” extension of the course.

(Future) — as I progress, you might see folders for web projects (HTML/CSS/JS/Flask), SQL/database assignments, or final-project work.

My Progress so Far

Completed foundational weeks: C, arrays & strings, memory allocation, data structures, algorithms.

Solutions are versioned and documented (code is committed in this repository).

Transitioned to Python for certain assignments/projects (reflected in CS50P folder).

Organized repository structure to keep languages/tracks separate, improving clarity and maintainability.

Goals & Next Steps

Continue working through remaining CS50 weeks / problem sets until full completion.

Once I start on a larger final project (if I choose to), I will create a dedicated folder (e.g. project/) with its own sub-folders.

Add a DESIGN.md for any nontrivial project — to explain design decisions, architecture, and implementation details. (CS50 recommends both a README for documentation and a design document for technical explanations.)

Ensure code is commented, and (if dependencies are required) include a requirements.txt so it’s easy to set up and run.

Why This Repository Exists

This repository serves multiple purposes:

Self-tracking: to keep my assignments, solutions, and progress organized over time.

Learning log: a record of how I progressed through CS50, which I can look back on later.

Portfolio: once I finish the course (or start a bigger project), this repo can showcase what I’ve built — helpful for interviews, collaboration, or sharing with others.

Reference: for myself (or anyone else) to revisit earlier assignments, compare approaches, or learn from my solutions.
